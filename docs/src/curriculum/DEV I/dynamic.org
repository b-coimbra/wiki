* dynamic type
  
  *Dynamic binding defers /binding/ - the process of resolving types, members, and operations
  from compile time to runtime.*

  Dynamic binding is useful when at compile time /you/ know that a certain function, member, or operation
  exists, but the /compiler/ does not. 
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC csharp
    dynamic d = GetsomeObject();
    d.Quack();
  #+END_SRC
  
  We expect the runtime type of *d* to have a *Quack* method. We just can't prove it statically.
  Since *d* is /dynamic/, the compiler deferes binding *Quack* to *d* until runtime.
