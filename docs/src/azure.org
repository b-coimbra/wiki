* Cognitive search
** params

   - =queryType= specifies the parser (=full= | =simple= (default))
   - =highlight= shows what word was matched

** notes

   - In queries containing rare and common terms, TF/IDF promotes results containing the rare term.
   - Some params become irrelevant if the query is marked as a fuzzy search (eg. ^+)

** Lucene Query
