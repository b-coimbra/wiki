* Comma and Braces Operators
  
  We can use comma and braces to:
  - rename and backup operations
  - pattern matching
    
  To backup settings.conf to settings.conf.bak:

    =cp settings.conf{,.bak}=
    
  To revert the file from settings.conf.bak to settings.conf:
  
    =mv settings.conf{.bak,}=
    
  Other uses:

  =echo foo{1,2,3}.txt= outputs =foo1.txt, foo2.txt, foo3.txt=
  
  =echo file-{a..b}.txt= outputs =file-a.txt file-b.txt file-c.txt file-d.txt=
  
  =mv program.{c,exe} bin/=
    
* Chaining Operators
  - *&* (Ampersand Operator)

    run one or more commands in the background,

    EXAMPLE: ping www.google.com &
             apt-get update & apt-get upgrade &
    
  - *;* (Semi-colon operator)

    run several commands at once sequentially, disregarding the exit status of the preceding command

    EXAMPLE: apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; mkdir test

  - *&&* (AND operator)

    executes a command IF the exit status of the preceding command is 0

    EXAMPLE: ping www.google.com && links www.google.com    (checking the connection before using links command)
    
  - *||* (OR operator)
    
    much like an 'else' statement, allows to execute the second command only if the execution
    of the first fails (i.e., the exit status is 1)
    
    EXAMPLE: apt-get update || links www.google.com

  - *!* (NOT operator)
    
    much like an 'except' statement, this command will execute all except the condition provided
    
    EXAMPLE: rm -r !(*.html)      removes all files in a folder except .html files
    
  - *|* (PIPE operator)

    passes the output of the first command to the second one

    EXAMPLE: ls -l | less
    
  - *{}* (Command Combination operator)

    combine two or more commands

    [ -d Folder] || { echo creating Folder; mkdir Folder; } && echo Folder exists.

* RegEx Tools

- *grep* (Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print)
  for searching stuff in files, or any STDOUT (eg. 'ls' command)
  
  EXAMPLE: ls | grep "\.exe$"
  
- *sed* (stream editor)
  for substitituing, deleting or filtering text on a stream
  
  EXAMPLE: sed 's/regexp/replacement/g' file > output
  
  -r will extend the Regex portability (POSIX)
  
- *xargs* (command args)
  pass any command to it and it will execute it on a stream.
  
  EXAMPLE: find | grep "\.exe$" | xargs ls -lh
  
* Bash

  [ -d Folder ]    checks if a folder exists
