** Pods
   
   Pods are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled and managed.
   It's a logical collection of containers that belong to an application.

** Master

   Master is the central point that provides a unified view of the cluster.
   There is a single master node that controls multiple minions.
   
** Minion
   
   Minion is a worker node that run tasks as delegated by master.
   Minions can run one or more pods. It provides an application-specific "virtual host" in a containerized environment.
