* Global Assembly Cache (GAC)
  
  =global= applies to the entire machine
  =assembly= what .NET calls its code-libraries (DLLs)
  =cache= a place to store things for common/faster access
  
  Basically, it's a way to keep DLLs globally accessible without worrying about conflicts.
  Everything is located at ~C:\\Windows\assembly~
  
  So the GAC must be a place to store code libraries so they're accessible to all applications running on the machine.
