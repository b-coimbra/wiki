* Destrutor (Finalizers)
  
  Finalizers (destructors in general) are used to perform necessary clean-ups when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector.

  #+BEGIN_SRC csharp
    class Car {
        ~Car { // finalizer
            // cleanup statements
        }
    }
  #+END_SRC

  A finalizer can also be defined as an expression body definition:

  #+BEGIN_SRC csharp
    public class Destroyer {
        ~Destroyer() => Console.WriteLine($"The {GetType().Name} destructor is executing.");
    }
  #+END_SRC
