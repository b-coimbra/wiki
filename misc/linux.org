* Shell expansion

  We can use shell expansion to:
  - rename and backup operations
  - pattern matching
  - match any string

** The =*= Wildcard

   - The =*= is a greedy operator that matches any string, incuding the null string.

   ~$ echo file*~ returns =file.log file.tex file.txt file.exe=
   ~$ echo *.tex~ returns =file.tex=

** The =?= Wildcard

   - The =?= matches a single character.

   ~$ echo file?.txt~ returns =file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt ...=

** Inverting Sets

   - The =^= character represents *not*.
     - =[abc]= means either *a, b* or *c*
     - =[^abc]= any character that is *not a, b* or *c*

** Brace Expansion

  To backup settings.conf to settings.conf.bak:

  ~cp settings.conf{,.bak}~

  To revert the file from settings.conf.bak to settings.conf:

  ~mv settings.conf{.bak,}~

  Other uses:

  ~echo foo{1,2,3}.txt~ outputs =foo1.txt, foo2.txt, foo3.txt=

  ~echo file-{a..b}.txt~ outputs =file-a.txt file-b.txt file-c.txt file-d.txt=

  ~mv program.{c,exe} bin/~
* IO Redirections
** Output redirections

  The output from a command normally intended for stdout can be easily diverted to a file.

  #+begin_src sh
	$ who > users

	$ cat users
	nexi     tty01    Oct 22 08:58
	ai       tty02    Oct 22 13:58
  #+end_src

  The ~>~ operator will always override the contents of the file.

  We can use the ~>>~ operator to *append* the output in a file with existing info:

  #+begin_src sh
	$ echo lorem ipsum >> users

	$ cat users
	nexi     tty01    Oct 22 08:58
	ai       tty02    Oct 22 13:58
	lorem ipsum
  #+end_src
** Input redirection

   Commands that receive input from stdin can have their input redirected from a file.

   #+begin_src sh
	 $ wc -l < users
	 3
   #+end_src

** Here document

   A "here document" redirects input into an interactive shell script or program.

   #+begin_src sh
	 command << EOF
		 document
	 EOF
   #+end_src

   The ~>>~ command is an instruction to read input until it finds a line containing the delimeted (EOF in this case)

   #+begin_src sh
	 $ wc -l <<EOF
	   lorem ipsum
	   dolor sit
	   amet
	 EOF
	 3
   #+end_src

* Chaining Operators
  - ~&~ (Ampersand Operator)

    run one or more jobs in the background,

    EXAMPLE: ping www.google.com &
             apt-get update & apt-get upgrade &

    - ~Ctrl-z~ pauses the job
    - ~jobs~ prints all the jobs

  - ~;~ (Semi-colon operator)

    run several commands at once sequentially, disregarding the exit status of the preceding command

    EXAMPLE: apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; mkdir test

  - ~&&~ (AND operator)

    executes a command IF the exit status of the preceding command is 0

    EXAMPLE: ping www.google.com && links www.google.com    (checking the connection before using links command)

  - ~||~ (OR operator)

    much like an 'else' statement, allows to execute the second command only if the execution
    of the first fails (i.e., the exit status is 1)

    EXAMPLE: apt-get update || links www.google.com

  - ~!~ (NOT operator)

    much like an 'except' statement, this command will execute all except the condition provided

    EXAMPLE: rm -r !(*.html)      removes all files in a folder except .html files

  - ~|~ (PIPE operator)

    passes the output of the first command to the second one

    EXAMPLE: ls -l | less

  - ~{}~ (Command Combination operator)

    combine two or more commands

    [ -d Folder] || { echo creating Folder; mkdir Folder; } && echo Folder exists.

* RegEx Tools

- ~grep~ (Globally search for a Regular Expression and Print)
  for searching stuff in files, or any STDOUT (eg. 'ls' command)

  EXAMPLE: =ls | grep "\.exe$"=

- ~sed~ (stream editor)
  for substitituing, deleting or filtering text on a stream

  EXAMPLE: =sed 's/regexp/replacement/g' file > output=

  -r will extend the Regex portability (POSIX)

- ~xargs~ (command args)
  pass any command to it and it will execute it on a stream.

  EXAMPLE: =find | grep "\.exe$" | xargs ls -lh=

* Bash

  | keybinding | description                    |
  |------------+--------------------------------|
  | ~ctrl-u~   | delete entire line             |
  | ~ctrl-l~   | clear screen                   |
  | ~ctrl-w~   | delete last word               |
  | ~ctrl-r~   | search through command history |
  | ~alt-.~    | cycles through last arguments  |
  | ~alt-*~    | expands glob                   |
* File System

  - /etc/: system-wide configuration folder (eg. pacman mirrorlist)
  - /bin/: common binary files for applications (eg. ls)
  - /boot/: stores my bootloader
  - /lib/: shared libraries that applications use
  - /mnt/: where external drives are mounted (eg. usbstick)
  - /opt/: manually installed softwares
  - /proc/: information about system processes and resources, each folder is a process' PID.
	- also contains other infos such as (/proc/cpuinfo)
  - /root/: volatile storage
  - /srv/: service directory, where service data is stored
  - /sys/: it's a way to interact with the hardware
  - /tmp/: where files are temporary stored in a session (eg. writing in a libreoffice file)
  - /usr/: user application's space, where applications will be installed
  - /var/: contains files that are supposed to grow (eg. logs)
  - /home/: where you store your own personal files
